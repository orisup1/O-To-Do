# O-To-Do
this is an expiriment project by my that was used mainly to learn the python library Tinkerer.

To run the program, use python3 mian.py inside the folder (and install Tinkerer),
i used no fancy app builder, just a file you run to lunch the app,

the app is very simple:
add task name and due date, complete and remove task by
pressing it, if completed, it will be moved to the completed group
remove all to clear all tasks in that list

note that the app doesn't save tasks that were open on other session, only those since lunch,
might add this feature in the future

i do know the main file is very messy and unorginized, but it works, which enough for now
