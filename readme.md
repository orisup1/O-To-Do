# O-To-Do
this experimental project was used mainly to learn the Python library Tinkerer.

To run the program, use python3 mian.py inside the folder (and install Tinkerer),
I used no fancy app builder, just a file you run to launch the app,

the app is straightforward:
add task name and due date, complete and remove task by
pressing it, if completed, it will be moved to the completed group
remove all to clear all tasks in that list

note that the app doesn't save tasks that were open on another session, only those since lunch,
might add this feature in the future

I do know the main file is very messy and unorganized, but it works, which is enough for now
